# 2. Signal analysis

The second part of the analysis is done using a **Python script**. This script takes as input the CSV file generated by the ImageJ plugin and outputs 3 different CSVs and 2 PNGs, concluding the analysis and storing all results. Following this, normalisation and statistical analysis are still required.


## User guide

### a. Installation

The script is available for download [here](https://github.com/matou1604/fluovoltanalysis_py/blob/main/feature_extraction.py). Once downloaded, you can drag the `.py` file into a specific folder of your choice. You can rename the file if you want to. 

As a code editor, it is recommended to download VSCode for a better experience when running the code. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The following packages are required to run the script:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will therefore need to install them. To do so, download python to your device (if not done already) and type the following commands one after the other in the terminal at the location of your file:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install seaborn
```
You can also create an environment with the required packages.

Once you're set up, open the script in VSCode and run it. The script will ask you to select the folder containing all subfolder with the CSV files you want to analyse.

<br>

### b. Running the script

To run the script, right-clic on the script an select ***Run in interactive window* > *Run current file in Interractive window***. This will open a new pane on the right and print all outputs in it. The script will ask you to select the folder containing all subfolder with the CSV files you want to analyse. And will then start the analysis.

Here is a preview of what the outputs for one signal look like:


```

```
Is the analysis of this signal good? 
Press Enter to save, or type anything else to skip.
```

If the analysis is good, press Enter. If not, type anything else and press Enter. The results of the badly analysed signal will still be saved, but will be stored with the boolean *Good analysis* as False. The script will then move on to the next signal.

## Results

The script will output 2 CSV files and 2 PNGs for each signal analysed. One additional CSV file is generated per condition/subfolder. 

The CSV files are:

- `_signal.csv:` contains the raw signal data, including the original time-series values and their normalized versions after processing. The time points for each mean intensity value is also included.

- `_apd.csv:` stores the computed Action Potential Duration (APD) data. The APD values are calculated using the scipy.signal.find_peaks function to detect peaks, followed by measuring the time it takes for the signal to repolarize to a certain percentage of its peak value. Peaks, troughs, and pretroughs are also saved in this file, where each row corresponds to a single beat.

- `_param_means.csv:` aggregates all extracted features and metrics of the analysis of one condition or subfolder. Here each row repesents the signal metrics of one signal, such as period, frequency, rise time, amplitude, and APD means. The *Good analysis* boolean values are also savd as a collumn here to keep track of the quality of the analysis.

The PNG files represent:

- `_plot.png:` displays the raw signal data with detected peaks, troughs, and APD points overlaid, helping to verify the accuracy of the analysis.

- `_singleplot.png:` focuses on a single beat, illustrating APD calculations in detail to highlight signal dynamics within an individual cycle.


The APD is computed as the time between the peak and the point where the signal reaches the percentage of the peak. The script then computes the mean of the APD for each beat and saves it in the `_apd.csv` file. The `_param_means.csv` file contains the mean of the APD for each beat, but only for one beat.

## Python code

The Python script processes the CSV files generated by the ImageJ plugin to extract relevant features and generate outputs as CSVs and images. It is designed to analyze multiple conditions stored in separate folders.

The process starts by selecting a folder containing different conditions. The script then loops through each condition folder, identifying and loading CSV files with raw signal data. Once loaded, the data undergoes preprocessing, which includes interpolation, smoothing, and baseline subtraction to improve signal clarity.

Next, the script detects peaks, troughs, and pretroughs in the signal. Peaks represent the highest points, troughs are the lowest points after a peak, and pretroughs are the lowest points before a peak. The alignment of these points is checked to ensure valid signal cycles. If any inconsistencies are found, the signal is skipped. It is also at this point that the signal is normalized to the baseline, which is computes as the mean of the troughs.

Once valid peaks and troughs are identified, the script computes key metrics such as period and frequency, signal amplitude, rise time, interpeak intervals, and action potential duration (APD) at different percentages. The APD values measure how long it takes for the signal to repolarize after the peak, which is useful for studying signal behavior and potentially arhythmias.

The results are saved as CSV files, and plots are generated to visualize the main extracted features. The user is then prompted to confirm whether the analysis is accurate and the answer is stored in a boolean value.
